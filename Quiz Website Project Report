Quiz Website Project Report

Abstract: This quiz website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It consists of a panel that displays questions, options, and a result section. The user can select an option by clicking on the buttons provided. After selecting an option, the user can click on the "Evaluate" button to check if their selection is correct or not. The result is displayed in the result section, with the text color indicating whether the answer is correct (green) or wrong (red). The user can then click on the "Next" button to move to the next question. The website dynamically updates the question, options, and result based on the user's progress.

Introduction:The Quiz Website is a web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this project is to provide a platform for users to participate in quizzes and evaluate their knowledge. The application presents multiple-choice questions to the users and provides immediate feedback on their answers. The project utilizes HTML for structuring the web page, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactivity and functionality.

Project Structure: The project consists of three main components: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file (`quiz website.html`) serves as the main structure of the web page, defining the layout and content. The CSS file (`quiz website.css`) provides the styling and design for the elements within the web page. The JavaScript file (`quiz website.js`) handles the dynamic behavior of the quiz website, including question iteration, answer selection, and result evaluation.

HTML Structure: The HTML file (`quiz website.html`) follows the standard structure of an HTML document. It contains a `<head>` section for meta information and linking the CSS file, and a `<body>` section for the actual content of the web page. Within the `<body>` section, the website is structured using `<div>` elements with specific class names to define different sections such as the question container, option container, result display, and navigation buttons.

CSS Styling: The CSS file (`quiz website.css`) defines the visual appearance and layout of the quiz website. It includes various CSS rules targeting specific elements and classes. The styling rules control properties such as background color, padding, margin, font size, and border radius. The CSS ensures a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for the quiz website.

JavaScript Functionality: The JavaScript file (`quiz website.js`) provides the dynamic functionality of the quiz website. It includes an array of question objects, each containing a question, answer options, and their correctness. The `iterate()` function is responsible for updating the question, answer options, and handling user selections. It also evaluates the selected answer upon clicking the "Evaluate" button and displays the result accordingly.

The script uses event listeners to track user clicks on answer options. When an option is clicked, the background color of the selected option changes, and the value of the selected option is stored for evaluation. The "Next" button triggers the iteration to the next question, updating the content based on the current question's ID.

Conclusion: The Quiz Website project demonstrates the integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and engaging quiz platform. The HTML structure provides the foundation for the web page layout, while CSS enhances the visual appeal. JavaScript adds interactivity by dynamically updating the content, handling user selections, and evaluating the results.

This project can serve as a starting point for further enhancements, such as adding a timer, implementing a score tracking system, or integrating a database to store questions and user progress. The possibilities for expanding the functionality and improving the user experience are extensive.
